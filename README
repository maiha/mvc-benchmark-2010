============

  Benchmark for MVC Frameworks in 2010


Frameworks
==========

  * play-scala (play-1.1-r912, scala-0.6)
  * sintara (sinatra-1.0, thin-1.2.7)
  * merb (merb-1.1.0, thin-1.2.7)

Conditions
==========

  * in production mode
  * disable logging
  * just respond "pong" string by "ping" action


Measure
=======

  first, hit 1000 times to run in caches

    ab -n 1000 http://localhost:3000/ping

  And then, measure req/s by 10000 requests.

    ab -n 10000 http://localhost:3000/ping


Scores
======

  sinatra: 1444.84
  play-scala: 1151.97
  merb: 1117.48


Environment
===========

  * OS : Ubuntu-9.10(x86_64)
  * CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q6600 (2.4GHz)
  * MEM: 16GB

  [NOTE]

    This machine is providing some services and there should be some noises.
    So I convince the scores are almost right, but not guarantee strictness.
